# 1up Health Demo Web Application
Example web application built using 1upHealth FHIR, User &amp; Connect APIs  

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/1uphealth/1upwebapp.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/1uphealth/1upwebapp)

## Before you start
Create an application via the 1uphealth devconsole [https://1up.health/devconsole](https://1up.health/devconsole) for testing purposes.  Use `http://localhost:3000/callback` for your app's callback url. Make sure you save your client secret as it'll only be shown once.

## Quickstart
1. Checkout source code from the repo
```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/1uphealth/1upwebapp.git
```


2. Add your API keys to app server session, ex. `vim ~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
```
export ONEUP_DEMOWEBAPPLOCAL_CLIENTSECRET="clientsecretclientsecret"
export ONEUP_DEMOWEBAPPLOCAL_CLIENTID="clientidclientid"
```
save this
```
source ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bash_profile
```
**For Windows:** - Add your API keys as Environment Variables. 
- In Search, search for and then select: System (Control Panel)
- Click the Advanced system settings link.
- Click Environment Variables.
- In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the PATH environment variable.
- Reopen Command prompt window, and run your code. 

3. Create `config.json` configuration file with the same client_id
```
{
  "baseURL": "http://localhost:3000",
  "clientId": "xxxxxxx",
  "__clientId": "the client id must be hardcoded here because this will be client side",
  "email": {
    "sender": "address@demo.com"
  }
}
```

4. Install & run the app
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. Run the email server (python 2.7)
```
sudo python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25
```

## Test Health Systems
You can test the demo web app with one of these [FHIR health system accounts](https://1up.health/dev/doc/fhir-test-credentials).

## Optional Setup: Setup email using actual email (relay) server
Either run a test local server for development
```
sudo python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25
```
Or setup email js for production in `auth.js`
```
var email 	= require("emailjs");
var server 	= email.server.connect({
   user:    "username",
   password:"password",
   host:    "smtp.your-email.com",
   ssl:     true
});
```
